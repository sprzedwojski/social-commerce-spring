intro.text=Reco4Social is a recommender systems that works on user's social media information.<br>\
  To start generating recommendations, it first needs a group of initial ratings of products.<br><br>\
  This is where you step in! <br><strong>Select categories of products that interest you \
  and rate items in those categories.</strong> \
  <br>The scale is from 0 (not interested in buying the item at all) \
  to 5 (you'd love to have it).<br>\
  Imagine no financial limitations - this is about personal preferences only.<br><br>\
  If you want to know more about the project, click the button below.<br> \
  Otherwise scroll down and have fun with the ratings! Thanks!
